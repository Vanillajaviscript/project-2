####Where will my project be in 5 years?
- Provide login page:

    <br>
- Styling:
    ```Provide cleaner styling to the nav bar, namely a drop down menu that provides register, login, and logout options.```
    <br>
- Complete refactoring of code where appropriate:
    ```Provide better organization, such as placing database connection in a separate folder, namely "config".```
