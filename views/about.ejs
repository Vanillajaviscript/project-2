        <h1>What about dogs?</h1>

        <p>Comparable to humans, the domestic dog is one of the most successful mammalian species on Earth. Dogs are distributed across most ecological niches and the global population has been estimated to range from 700 million to 1 billion dogs. In contrast to rodents, whose high abundance is enabled by their cryptic exploitation of human resources and their fast reproduction, the high distribution of dogs has been attributed to their ability to directly interact with humans. It has been suggested that various morphological, hormonal, neurological, behavioral and cognitive skills of dogs have newly emerged specifically to live in human groups and communicate with humans. This human-centered approach to the social evolution of dogs has, however, ignored that most dogs worldwide, although living alongside humans, mainly associate with conspecifics. Even when living as pets, many dogs live within human families in multiple dog-households, not to mention that more than 70% of the entire dog population is constituted by “village” and “feral” dogs. Village dogs inhabit urban or suburban environments and may live either solitarily or in groups of 3 to 27 individuals. Feral dogs typically live in forested areas with no or minimal human contact, hunting on small prey and scavenging on human refuse. Living in such variable dog-human groups raises the possibility that rather than having specifically adapted to interact and form “special” bonds with humans (domestication hypotheses), dogs might use the same social behavioral repertoire and establish similar bonds with both humans and other dogs.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In order to test this hypothesis, it is necessary to compare the relationships that dogs form with humans and with conspecifics. However, to date such a direct comparison is still missing. Instead, two independent lines of research have investigated either dogs' inter- or intra-specific relationships. Regarding their relationship with humans, it has been argued that dogs have evolved a novel capacity to form attachment to members of our species, as they use their caregivers for stress alleviation and information seeking similarly to what is observed in human infants. At the same time, research on dog-dog relationships has focused on other relationship components, such as affiliation and dominance, with results showing that dogs can form strong affiliative bonds with each other that can affect multiple aspects of their life, such as mating preferences, food sharing, cooperation, and so on. These two lines of research focus on different components and different functions of relationships, and the only aspect they share is that both have demonstrated that dogs form differential relationships with both humans and conspecifics. As such, it is difficult to compare whether the types of relationships established by dogs with humans and conspecifics are in fact different. Hence in the current study we adopted a different approach and aimed at first determining the types of relationships dogs develop with humans and with conspecifics and subsequently investigating whether dog-human relationships are indeed different to dog-dog relationships.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To achieve our aims, we developed a novel test mimicking a series of situations that pet dogs, during their everyday life, may naturally face both with their owners and with other dogs. This so-called “Relationship test” was used to identify various components of pet dogs' relationships that are not strictly associated with the attachment system and to characterize the different types of relationships dogs may establish with human and dog partners. For this aim, we presented dog-dog and dog-owner dyads with situations that involved a chance to explore a novel environment, a separation and reunion phase, and the appearance of a novel, potentially fear-evoking object. An in-depth behavioral analysis of dogs' behaviors with their conspecific partner and with their owner was carried out, in order to characterize and compare different intra- and inter-specific relationship types. In a second step, to assess the functional role of these different relationships, we presented the same dog-owner and dog-dog dyads with a “Social Threat test” where we compared whether dogs' reactions to a masked human approaching the dyad in a threatening manner were influenced by the relationship the dogs had with the partner present.</p>
