      body: "Some ties can’t be broken. This was certainly the case with Cleo, a yellow labrador-mix who went missing earlier this month. Thankfully, Cleo was found, but it was in the unlikeliest of places—her owner’s previous home. When Colton Michael found an unfamiliar dog on his porch, he assumed it belonged to a nearby neighbor. Once he earned Cleo’s trust, Michael took her to have her microchip scanned. The results were astonishing—Cleo belonged to his home’s previous owner! Even after two years, Cleo was still attached to her old house. Despite what they say, you really can go home again.",

      body: "A pair of hikers trapped in an avalanche were saved by a mysterious dog after the canine barked for help. The canines attracted the attention of nearby walkers who were able to dig them out, the air ambulance service Rega said. The avalanche swept the pair off a hiking trail in the Avers Valley of southwestern Switzerland, near the Italian border and west of St Moritz, shortly after 3pm (local time) on Saturday, Rega said in a statement. The hero dog seemed to come out of nowhere and provided attention so that emergency services were quick to respond before impending doom on the hikers became imminent.",
